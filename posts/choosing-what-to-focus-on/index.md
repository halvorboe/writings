When moving through life there is always the question of what to focus
on. There is only a finite amount of time left on this planet. That time
needs to be spent in a way that’s good enough. That is why I have been
thinking about what to learn about.

Choosing what to learn about is really hard for me because I’m
interested in a lot of different subjects, but at the same time, I have
very little time.

My hope is that this blog will reflect what I’m currently learning
about. Currently, that would be databases. I want to learn more about
it.

When starting a career as a software engineer, the most difficult part
is choosing what technologies to focus on. It does not matter until it
does. Knowing a certain programming language is not useful until there
is a test in that language. A lot of companies open when it comes to
programming languages, allowing any programming language within reason.
