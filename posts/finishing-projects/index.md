Starting a project is easy. Finishing a project is really hard.

That is the fundamental problem for most people. For me, this includes
starting companies, contributing to open source projects, and a ton of
personal projects. This blog is one of those persona projects, and this
article is a project.

Starting this article was easy, but finishing it will be really hard.
Especially since I did not follow the proper process for writing an
article and the structure is not defined, to begin with. That causes
problems now because I have no idea where the article will go.

Anyways, let’s look into how we can solve this problem.

The first part for me is good task management. I use “Todoist” and it is
working well. It allows me to easily add tasks and do them, without any
more complicated logic.

The second part for me is to accept when a project has failed and give
up. This might seem counterintuitive because it means failing at
projects ad not finishing them. My view is different. Accepting that a
project has failed means finishing it. It means that no more time will
be wasted and that other projects can be prioritized.
