About 10 years ago I started coding. It began with creating a HTML page
om my laptop and opening it in the browser. Not technically coding, but
it was a beginning. Gooing deeper I started learning about how to build
web pages. I started learning Django and how to use a database. A
tangent here is that Django allowed me to learn how to use a database
without knowing what a database was or how to use one - but that is a
topic for another post.

When I started at university I had a good comprehension of Python and
Java. I started learning Java and started using that in my Python code.
This is where the faults of Python became clear, there was no way to
write Python without massive amounts of tests. I started learning about
testing. I should have used mocking, but Django made it easy to just
test against an actual database.

That is where MyPy comes in - the type checker for Python. It
transformed my view on Python because it removed many of the critical
flaws. In conclusion, Python is useful for two things:

  - > Hacky scripts.

  - > High-quality type-checked code.
